# libreoffice_themes

1. copy the images_office zip file into these folders 

    /usr/share/libreoffice/share/config/
    
    /usr/lib/libreoffice/share/


2. copy the deepin folder into your ~/.themes or ~/.local/share/themes folder 

3. Open libreoffice writer and click on options , go to general -> view and select your icon style  , which should be named as office2013

  and look like this : 

  <img src = libr.png> 

4. Copy the libree.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications, it will just open libreoffice writer* with the deepin light gtk theme .
